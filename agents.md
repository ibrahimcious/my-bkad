•⁠  ⁠Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
•⁠  ⁠Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy to keep main context window clean
•⁠  ⁠Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
•⁠  ⁠For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
•⁠  ⁠One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
•⁠  ⁠After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md' with the pattern
•⁠  ⁠Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
•⁠  ⁠Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
•⁠  ⁠Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
•⁠  ⁠Never mark a task complete without proving it works
•⁠  ⁠Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
•⁠  ⁠Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
•⁠  ⁠Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
•⁠  ⁠For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
•⁠  ⁠If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
•⁠  ⁠Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
•⁠  ⁠Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
•⁠  ⁠When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
•⁠  ⁠Point at logs, errors, failing tests -> then resolve them
•⁠  ⁠Zero context switching required from the user
•⁠  ⁠Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1.⁠ ⁠*Plan First*: Write plan to 'tasks/todo.md' with checkable items
2.⁠ ⁠*Verify Plan*: Check in before starting implementation
3.⁠ ⁠*Track Progress*: Mark items complete as you go
4.⁠ ⁠*Explain Changes*: High-level summary at each step
5.⁠ ⁠*Document Results*: Add review to 'tasks/todo.md'
6.⁠ ⁠*Capture Lessons*: Update 'tasks/lessons.md' after corrections

## Documented Solutions

`docs/solutions/` — documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns, architecture decisions), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (`module`, `tags`, `problem_type`). Relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas.

## Core Principles
•⁠  ⁠*Simplicity First*: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
•⁠  ⁠*No Laziness*: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
•⁠  ⁠*Minimal Impact*: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
